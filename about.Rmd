# About Me

Hi, Iâ€™m Tucker ðŸ‘‹.  
Iâ€™m an air quality scientist by day and a home cook by night.  
I started this site to collect and share my favorite recipes, so I can 
cook them again and again â€” and maybe inspire others to try them too!

When Iâ€™m not cooking, I enjoy weightlifting, baking, and hand-sewing projects.
